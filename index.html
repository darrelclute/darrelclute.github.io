        <div class="article_text">
          <p>Darrel Clute is an IT Infrastructure Architect.  Throughout his career he has
been predominately focused on Network Engineering, but has spent equal amounts
of time focused on Systems Engineering, primarily with UNIX based systems.
Beyond his employment Darrel is also an advocate for Open Source software use
in the enterprise as well as for by individuals, but will never advocate the use
of Open Source purely for the sake of it.</p>
<p>Outside of his core competencies Darrel also has extensive experience with
proprietary and Open Source virtualization platforms.  His knowledge and
experience with IaaS solutions such as OpenStack are constantly increasing as
well.  Additionally through his Systems Engineering experience Darrel has been
exposed to and supported various web and enterprise applications.  The most
recent exposure has been to PaaS solutions, and this has led to advocation that
either a Public or Private cloud offering is not complete without a coupling of
both Iaas and PaaS solutions designed and deployed in lock-step.</p>
<p>Beyond core infrastructure Darrel has at various times, and especially more so
recently, been developing programing skills to augment his daily activities.
Throughout his career Darrel has utilized various languages and utilities to
automate infrastructure.  Some of Darrel's programming has been with the use of
Bash, net-snmp, sed, awk, and holistically with Python.</p>

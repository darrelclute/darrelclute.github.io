OpenPGP Key Transition Statement for Darrel Ray Clute, III

I have created a new OpenPGP key and will be transitioning away from
my old key.  The old key has not been compromised and will continue to
be valid for some time, but I prefer all future correspondence to be
encrypted to the new key, and will be making signatures with the new
key going forward.

I would like this new key to be re-integrated into the web of trust.
This message is signed by both keys to certify the transition.  My new
and old keys are signed by each other.  If you have signed my old key,
I would appreciate signatures on my new key as well, provided that
your signing policy permits that without re-authenticating me.

The old key, which I am transitioning away from, is:

pub   rsa4096/0x778346C225CA8B71 2014-02-24
      Key fingerprint = B6D4 6D64 F0C2 2513 B5EA  5E5C 7783 46C2 25CA 8B71

The new key, to which I am transitioning, is:

pub   rsa4096/0x54816ED6261FCA30 2015-07-06 [expires: 2016-01-04]
      Key fingerprint = 58A5 4A51 58F1 C5DA C51E  A537 5481 6ED6 261F CA30

The entire key may be downloaded from:https://www.darrelclute.net/pgp-public-key.txt

To fetch the full new key from a public key server using GnuPG, run:

  gpg --recv-key 0x54816ED6261FCA30

If you already know my old key, you can now verify that the new key is
signed by the old one:

  gpg --check-sigs 0x54816ED6261FCA30

If you are satisfied that you've got the right key, and the User IDs
match what you expect, I would appreciate it if you would sign my key:

  gpg --sign-key 0x54816ED6261FCA30

You can upload your signatures to a public keyserver directly:

  gpg --send-key 0x54816ED6261FCA30

Or email darrel@darrelclute.net (possibly encrypted) the output from:

  gpg --armor --export 0x54816ED6261FCA30

If you'd like any further verification or have any questions about the
transition please contact me directly.

To verify the integrity of this statement:

  wget -q -O- https://www.darrelclute.net/pgp-transition-statement.txt --verify

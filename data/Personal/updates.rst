I haven't been updating this site very often and a lot has changed.
Rachel and I moved out of the apartment that we were in originally when
we got married and have been living in a house since April. We've taken
a lot of pictures over the past several months as well, including from
our trip to Louisiana, and we'll get them posted soon as well. I am
starting to build out my portfolio on this site, it is no where near
complete so check back soon to view its updates.

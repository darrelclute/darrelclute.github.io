It has now been a couple of weeks since the wrap of CiscoLive, just a
short update.  I am still working on developing my plans regarding how I
am going to be tackling regaining my expired certifications and the
training process around that.  The Packet Pushers have published `Show
153`_ which I had the privilege of participating in along with many
other prominent technologists from the Social Media and Blogging realms,
have a listen if you haven't already.

I have a few new blog posts in draft at the moment that I am hoping to
get out later this week.  Also I am working on some updates to my site
and blog design and some backend application work to be able to better
integrate the two, that may take a bit longer to get out although I have
some of that work completed.

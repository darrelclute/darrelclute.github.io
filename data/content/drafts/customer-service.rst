In a, now not so, recent post I spoke of how a customer service company failed at customer service, and I've seen this with other customer service companies as well. In each instance what ultimately causes this to occur is a loss of focus on the primary individuals that a customer service company is to make happy, the customers and not the owners. The vast majority of the time that this occurs it is in publicly traded companies although privately held companies can, and have, also fallen trap to this loss of focus, for multiple reasons.
First lets identify some customer service organizations to get an understanding of the type of company that I'm referring to. AT&amp;T is a phone service company. DirecTV is a satellite service company. Comcast is a cable service company. Notice a trend? All of these companies provide services to customers and not products. Sure they call their offerings products, and they may actually provide you with equipment, but this isn't their primary focus, its providing a service to customers.

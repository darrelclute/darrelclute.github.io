Over the past few years talks regarding subjects of Software Defined Networking (SDN), OpenFlow, Network Virtualization Overlays and many other technologies which promise to simplify computer networking.  Many of these technologies are only pieces to the puzzle of truly making the process of networking simplified.  I do want to clarify that this will be a simplification to the provisioning of the network and reacting to changes within the network or applications consuming the network.  We are not likely to see a wholesale replacement of existing network technologies which have been in place for decades now, but a way to programmatically influence these.  Nor will these new technologies be in place in every network in every respect.  The fact that asking any number of engineers what SDN is or is going to be will get you responses from what is SDN to too many conceptual ideas to count, we are still too early to know what exactly this marketing term will result in.

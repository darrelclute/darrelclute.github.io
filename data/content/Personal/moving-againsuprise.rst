Well, we are going to be moving again. This time instead of again moving
within Albion we are moving closer to my work. We'll be moving to a town
house in BriarCliffe on Jolly, just east of Aurelius, in Lansing during
the beginning of October. Its a two bedroom one and a half bath two
story town home with a full half-finished basement. For the two of us
this will be adequate but in eight to nine months that may no longer be
the case. We just found out this past weekend that Rachel is pregnant.
The next several months will likely prove to be quite busy in light of
moving as well as having a baby on the way.

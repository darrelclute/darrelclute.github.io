Django Live

I've got my site moved over to using `Django`_ now. I haven't written my
application yet so the site isn't complete as of yet. As of right now
only the blog is truly dynamic, although everything is stored in the
database but not as dynamic as the blog pages. Right now the site is
powered by `Django`_ and a few of the pre-built applications included
with it as well as from `Google Code`_.

I am going to build my application around the components that are
already powering the site and include them in the views of my
application so that content from more then just the one application will
be included on the page and better utilize the space. What definitely
will be done is under the navigation to the left will be a section
listing out the most recent blog post titles, probably 5 or less, and
possibly a random image from the gallery once its up and working. I'm
also working on correcting an issue with the blog app that I'm running
into when comments are enabled, so once I get that corrected you'll be
able to comment to my blog posts and probably to the gallery.

I've not done much in the way of layout design therefore what you see
presently may not be the final representation of my site. What I've done
thus far is fairly good for my first attempt at designing a page layout.
The site layout is pure CSS without tables or javascript. The only
javascript present on the site is the `Google Ads`_ generator. My thanks
to both `W3 Schools`_ and `Dynamic Drives`_ for their tutorials and
examples which helped me to build out this sites design. I'm still
working on completing the navigation bar, I'm planning on having it
cascade out for the submenus but I'm still working on getting everything
right so that it will be completed with CSS alone. This layout is fully
XHTML 1.0 and CSS 2.1 compliant and will validate as such.

This is the first blog post on my `Django`_ based site. I like the admin
section a lot better then that of `Drupal`_. Look for future posts to
this site.

It is that time of year once again, Summer Camp for Geeks otherwise known as
`CiscoLive! US <https://www.ciscolive.com/us/>`_ has arrived.  I am headed down
to Orlando to join with around 30,000 others for several days of training,
hallway tracks, socializing, and a bit of fun.  

Tech Field Day will be present again this year with presentation on Monday 6/11
through Wednesday 6/13.  I have been asked to be a delegate for both the Monday
and Wednesday sessions.  The full sessions for this `Tech Field Day Extra are
available and will be live streamed from here
<http://techfieldday.com/event/clus18/>`_.  Monday's sessions will have a focus
on data centers with Wednesday's sessions having a focus on cloud and
multicloud technologies.  I am honored to once again be involved with Tech
Field Day at CiscoLive! this year.  You can find the previous events that I've
participated in at my `Tech Field Day Delegate Page
<http://techfieldday.com/people/darrel-clute/>`_.

My plane will be boarding shortly so will wrap up this short post for now.  See
everyone in Orlando in a couple of hours.

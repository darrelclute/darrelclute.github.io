It is almost that time of year again.  `Cisco Live US`_ is right around the
corner and there is a lot to look forward to.  `Cisco Live US`_ this year is in
San Francisco California, May 18th through the 22nd at the Moscone Center.  I
will be in attendance again this year, third year in a row and fourth total.


================
Weeks Activities
================

I will be arriving in San Francisco on Saturday the 17th at about 2:00 PM PDT.
With registration being open on Saturday I will be ensuring that I get all of
that out of the way prior to event sessions starting on Sunday.

My tentative schedule of sessions is in the tables at the bottom of this
article.  I say that this is tentative as I am subject to make changes to this
as slide decks are posted to `Cisco Live Online`_ and I review to ensure that I
am getting the best of the event.

In addition to the sessions there are other activities that I typically partake
in and even draw benefit from.  The customer appreciation event is a good wind
down to the multitude of sessions.  This year Lenny Kravitz and Imagine Dragons
will be performing for us at AT&T Park.  For those of you that aren't aware of
the weather in San Francisco in May, it will likely be a good idea to have a
jacket for the customer appreciation event, as this is an outdoor stadium.

`Cisco Live Social Networking`_ is ever growing and gives you an opportunity to
meet and talk with people you interact online with `Twitter`_, `Google Plus`_,
or your social media platform of choice.  There will be opening and closing
TweetUps specifically for this, in addition to the social media lounge being a
place where a number of us hang out when we are not in a session.

Mixing it up a bit this year on the exam front.  Every prior year that I have
attended a Cisco Live event I have taken the CCIE Route/Switch written exam,
and usually haven't had sufficient time to study, and recently traditional
route/switch has not been my focus.  This year I will be attempting the CCIE
Data Center written exam.  Although I have not really had time to devote to
studying, these are the technologies I have been interacting with more
regularly as of late.

New this year, Cisco `DevNet`_, formerly Cisco Developer Network, will have a
`DevNet Zone`_ where you can come and try your hands and working with the APIs
and SDKs through a learning lab or the hackathon.  There will be theater
sessions and ask the experts where you can get high level overview or deep
dives with the expert respectively.  Additionally they will have partners in
the `DevNet Zone`_ to talk specifically about their technologies and how they
are leveraging Cisco's programmability features.  The `DevNet Zone`_ may
preempt some of my sessions as a significant amount of my free time has been
around addressing automation, and being able to better control and monitor
environments.

There will likely be other activities after hours that I will be partaking in
as well, and if last year is an indication I will probably be hanging out with
people I interact with online more than day-to-day.


================
Closing Thoughts
================

I am really looking forward to attending Cisco Live again this year.  If you
are in the networking space, or any aspect of the data center space, I highly
recommend you attend at least once.  For me personally I attend as the
educational consumption model works better for me than other venues.
Additionally it gets me out of my inverted shell a bit for a short period of
time.  Look forward to seeing everyone this year and being able to talk in
person with people I haven't seen in nearly a year.

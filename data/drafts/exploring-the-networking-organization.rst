Whether we talk about an Internet Service Provider (ISP), a Hosting Service Provider (HSP), or an Application Service Provider (ASP), we should see some organizational similarities. Even small, medium and large enterprises would benefit from having some organizational similarities to service providers. Unfortunately this is not always the case, as some never grow out of their infancy. While each of the aforementioned service provider types, even enterprises, will operate in different fashions based on their goals and clientele, it is their core that should be organized the same. Of course the core of any sizable business in the modern economy is their network. Without the network they would not be able to operate their business in an efficient manner based on modern standards. We are going to take a walk down the progression of a networking organization from startup to global company. The focus will be on a service provider as they are the most dependent on their network. Join me for the journey of fictional model company Service Provider International, SPI.

Thin Computing
##############


Why do I choose this as the truest form of thin client computing? Because the devices that sit on your desk are simply input/output conversion devices. They do no processing outside of displaying video updates and accepting keyboard and mouse input. The Linux Terminal Server Project provides similar functionality but the client hardware is expected to perform more of the processing then the Sunray products therefore requiring less energy efficient devices. Windows or Citrix terminal services and thin clients rely upon embedded operating systems on the client hardware, requiring even more processing power

Change is the Only Constant

You have already noticed that the title of this article is a phrase that you
have heard many times before.  You may not be entirely sure of its origin but
it still strikes a familiar chord.  This translated phrase of one of the
philosophical tenants of Greek Philosopher `Heraclitus`_ has undoubtedly
influenced much of humankind's disruptive leaders, or at a minimum been the
ingrained impetus that has driven such.  The IT industry has always been in a
state of constant flux, something that few other industries can claim.
Currently the IT industry is undergoing the most disruptive changes to the
industry in the previous 10-15 years.  Arguably portions of the industry, if
not the whole, are being met with the fastest rate of change or amount of
disruptive changes in their history.  What are some of these?

`DevOps`_ was arguably one of the first movements that has sparked the
multitude of changes we are seeing.  When Amazon began offering their
`Infrastructure as a Service`_ (IaaS) product in 2006, it definitely sent a
shock through the web hosting industry which I was employed in during the time.
Additionally their were other companies that leveraged similar methodologies or
even Amazon's services in unique ways.  Many in IT had never even conceived of
doing things in these ways and brushed off what Amazon, Etsy, Netflix and
Google were doing as experiments that would not last nor scale.  Ironically,
working in the web hosting industry at the time I and others thought that what
these companies were doing was normal, just in a newer more encompassing manner.

Highlighting further the theme of this post, I had originally began this post
in the beginning of 2011 as I was ending a contract and looking for a new
opportunity or starting my own business again.  Although at the time I had
already seen foreshadowing of much of what I have described in this post at
this time, not much of what I have detailed here was intended to be in the
original incarnation of this post.  As I have pointed out in the introduction,
change is constant, and nothing is precluded from such.
